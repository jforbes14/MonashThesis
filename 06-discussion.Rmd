# Conclusion {#ch:Conclusion}

In this thesis we have demonstrated how socio-demographic information from the Census can be linked to electorates for each Australian federal election between 2001 and 2016, even in years in which a Census did not occur. This involved cleaning, wrangling and imputing the data into workable $R$ objects, making use of our newly devised spatial imputation
algorithm. We have contributed this data to the existing `eechidna` `R` package, for public use. We then modelled the two-party preferred vote in each election as a function of socio-demographic characteristics, and used these models to analyse the effects over time. Our models are able to reveal richer insights than those currently existing in the literature.

Primarily, we find that most of the socio-demographic effects *have not* changed drastically over time. Since we have standardized each variable within each Census year (mean 0, variance 1), we are effectively looking at the *relative* effects of each predictor within that election. Therefore, we conclude that the *relative* socio-demographics, rather than *absolute* socio-demographics have influence in driving electorate preference between the two major parties.

## Extensions and caveats

### Spatial dependencies
A Moran's I test of the residuals in each election reveals significant evidence of spatial correlation (2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016). For this test, we consider the residuals of each electorate to be correlated with electorates it shares a boundary with.

\end{table}

Although ordinary least-squares estimates are still consistent, standard errors should be adjusted. An extension that we plan to pursue is to use the Spatial Error Model, which allows for spatial correlation in the residuals (spatial heterogeneity).

The spatial error model is specified:

$$y = X \beta + (I_n-\rho W)^{-1}\varepsilon$$

Estimation can be done using the `spdep` package.

### Spatial imputation using a finer level of disaggregation
Imputing electorate profiles using Census data aggregated at *division* level should provide reasonable estimates, but perhaps using the lowest level of disaggregation (mesh blocks) could improve accuracy. We did do this but with postal areas, of which there are approximately 2,400 in Australia. Using the 2011 Census divisions as a test case, we estimated test error using both postal areas and Census divisions from the 2006 and 2016 Censuses. There was no evidence to suggest that postal areas improved the accuracy of the imputation, compared with the higher aggregation level of Census divisions.

### Considering polling booths, rather than electorates
Matching polling booths with their Census collection districts, which is done in existing Australian socio-political studies, presents another way to model voter behaviour. Instead of having $n=150$, we would have $n=6000$. However, modelling results at electorate level is still the key point of interest because electorates ultimately determine the results of Australian federal elections. It is unclear whether this higher degree of resolution will provide any greater insight, as our findings confirm and add to the existing literature of studies that use polling booths.
