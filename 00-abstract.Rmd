# Abstract {-}

This research consists of an examination of the relationships between electoral socio-demographic characteristics and two-party preference in Australian federal elections. The six elections occuring from 2001 to 2016 are considered in this study. Socio-demographic information is derived from the Census, and calculated for each electorate in each election using a spatio-temporal method of imputation. Each election is modelled as a separate cross-section, using the same model specification, consisting of ten socio-demographic variables and four two-way interactions. Insights regarding the changing effects of socio-demographic variables are obtained by comparing estimated effects across elections using visualisation tools from various `R` packages. These insights reveal that electoral socio-demographics *relative* to those of other electorates at the same point in time are consistent drivers of preference between the Labor and Liberal parties. All data processed in this study will be contributed to the existing `eechidna` `R` package.
