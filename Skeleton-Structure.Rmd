# What makes Australians vote the way they do? A socio-demographic study of federal elections.

## Acknowledge

## Declaration

## Abstract

To be written last


## Introduction

Motivation

- The changing Australian demographic

- Perhaps some news headlines to show it is topical


Explicitly state the question to be answered

- Inference


Outline the challenges involved


Outline the techniques that are going to be used


Literature review

- Conclusions from previous Australian election studies

- Imputation methods

- Modelling techniques for elections 

- PCA

- Xway models


## The data

State the data sources


Summary of the data

- Summary statistics

- Explanation of each metric


Insights from the Census data

- Changes in demographics (as alluded to in introduction)


Further explanation of the problem

- Changing electorate boundaries

- Changes over time


Show the format data was accessed


Outline any missingness in the data


## Imputation algorithm

Discuss the potential options

- Again reference what has been done


Outline the idea behind my algorithm, and why it should perform better

- State assumptions


Step through the algorithm

- Include pictures to illustrate

- Use my poster graphic


Comparison of imputations

- Be explicit in how I am comparing (MAPE)

- Extreme case example


Caveats

- Time scale is much larger


## Modelling the two-party preferred

PCA

- Motivation for doing it

- Interpret the PVE and PCs

- Ellipsoids to demonstrate the pockets of ALP/LNP

- PCR for 2016


Converting to factors

- Refer to PC loadings interpretation


Single year models

- Use 2016 to explain the method, and just print the results for other years

- Start by including the summarised set of variables

- Xway models and conclusions of best predictors

- Interpretation of each year (possible subheadings)

- Diagnostics


Longitudinal model

- Method to build up

- Assumptions required

- Model

- Interpretation

- Diagnostics


## Modelling full voter preference for 2016 (TBC)

Dirichlet model using the same 'best' covariates from 2016 to model all parties

Do conclusions change?


## Discussion

Assumptions of imputation method (TBC - may be repeating myself)

- Uniform distribution

- Linear changes over time (e.g. sudden refugee intake)

- Encouraging: CED performed better than POA

- How time scale is different


Further improvements

- ?


## Conclusions

Recap

- The need for imputation algorithm and why it helps

- Conclusions of variable importance from models


Insights

- What is the most important predictor

- What has changed over the years
