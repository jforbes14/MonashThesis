# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Over the last two decades, Australia has changed in many ways. Rising house prices, country-wide improvements in education, an ageing population, and a decline in religious affiliation, are just a few facets of the country's evolving socio-demographic characteristics. At the same time, political power has moved back and forth between the two major parties - the Australian Labor Party (Labor) and the Liberal National coalition (Liberal). The two-party preferred vote, a measure of support between these two parties, has been as high as 53.5% and as low as 47.3% in favour of the Liberal party.

These simultaneous changes lead to our question - *what socio-demographic characteristics are key determinants of electorate support between the Labor and Liberal parties, and how have their effects changed over time?*

Existing studies of the 2001, 2004 and 2007 Australian federal elections have found that relationships exist between socio-demographic characteristics (simply, socio-demographics) and voting behaviour, at an aggregate level. However, as far as we can see, there are no existing studies that investigate elections from 2010 onwards. Section \@ref(ch:litreview) contains a literature review of previous modelling of Australian federal elections.

This thesis explores the dynamics of electorate party preference for all six federal elections from 2001 to 2016, using an econometric framework. To gather insights on temporal trends, along with individual elections, the two-party preferred vote is modelled as a function of electorate socio-demographics.

Socio-demographics are characteristics of a population, such as the distributions of age, gender, ethnicity, education level and income. The socio-demographic information used in this study is from the Australian Census of Population and Housing (Census), a country-wide survey conducted every five years. Federal elections on the other hand, are generally conducted every three years. There are 150 electorates in Australia, with each corresponding to a single seat in the federal House of Representatives. It is electorates that determine the result of Australian federal elections, which is why electorates are chosen as the level of aggregation for this study. Therefore, the electoral two-party preferred vote is the outcome of interest for each election, and Census data used in this study is aggregated to Commonwealth Electoral Divisions, which is an of approximation the electorate boundaries.

Both the two-party preferred vote and socio-demographic data possess a spatial component and a temporal component as they repesent a region of Australia and are measured at a particular point in time. Census and elections often occur in different years, and electoral boundaries change frequently. Therefore, in order to match socio-demographics with the electoral two-party preferred vote for each election, a method of spatio-temporal imputation is adopted. This involves estimating an electorate's socio-demographic composition at the time of a Census, using an areal imputation approach, and then linearly interpolating between Census years to approximate the socio-demographics of each electorate, at election time. To adjust for temporal trends in socio-demographics, each socio-demographic variable is centered to have a mean of zero and standardized to have a variance of one. A full description of the data and how it is sourced, transformated and imputated is detailed in Section \@ref(ch:Data). The resultant cross-sectional data set for each election have $n=150$ electorates and $p=63$ socio-demographic predictors.

Each election is modelled separately in order to capture the election-specific effects of socio-demographics. Doing so results in the problem of having a small sample size $n$ and a large number of predictors $p$. Section \@ref(ch:Modelling) elaborates on why each election is modelled separately, explains the steps taken to reduce the reduce the dimension of the data sets. 

The first step involves grouping similar socio-demographic variables together into *factors*. Principal component analysis of socio-demographic variables is employed to determine which variables should be grouped, by identifying groups of variables that have large loadings in one the first four components. Factors are also centered and standardized. This results in a reduced set of $p=30$ predictors. From this reduced set, all possible five variable linear models are fit for each election, with the two-party preferred vote as the response. This functions as a model set for which Akaike weights are calculated, and relative variable importance is determined for that election. Using this information-theoretic technique, the five most important variables are identified for each of the six elections. A superset is formed by taking the union of these important socio-demographics, which results in a set of 10 variables.

Identical model specification is used for each election, by regressing the two-party preferred vote on the the superset of $p=10$ predictors and four two-way interactions. Models are estimated separately using ordinary least squares. Insights are then found (Section \@ref(ch:Insights)) by analysing how socio-demographic effects change over the elections, with main effects interpreted using partial residual plots, and two-way interactions depicted by two-dimensional contour plots.

All content produced in this study is reproducible and the interpolated data has been made publicly available, making this project a resource for future research. A key deliverable is the contribution made to the existing `eechidna` [^1] R package, which includes the GIS maps, data from all Censuses and elections, and the imputed socio-demographic electorate profiles at the time of each election. When future elections and Censuses come around, the `eechidna` package will provide a resource for anyone wishing to conduct their own socio-political analysis.
