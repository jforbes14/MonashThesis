# Introduction {#ch:intro}

This research examines the relationships between socio-demographics and voting behaviour in Australian federal elections since 2001, in order to answer the questions as to why Australians vote the way they do, and how this has changed over time. Socio-demographics are characteristics of a population, such as percentage breakdowns by age, gender, ethnicity, education level and income, and are gathered from the Australian Census of Population and Housing. Voting outcomes and population characteristics are aggregated at the electorate level, using spatial analysis to map demographics from censuses falling either side of an election to that particular election. 

At the centre of this study is the exploration of two key questions:

1. What are the demographic factors that affect preference between the two major parties?

2. What factors are linked with electorate support for the full poltiical spectrum?

3. How have these changed over time?

The study differs from more common voting studies in three main ways. First, it uses spatial modelling tools to connect socio-demographic information to an election from censuses either side of that election. Secondly, it considers predictive modelling for electorate voting behaviour, and thirdly it combines information across multiple elections.  

# data sources and merging
In order to match information from each census and election since 2001, data in the Geographic Information Software (GIS) format is analysed and overlayed - the dominant approach in spatial studies. Methodologies for intersecting and interpreting GIS objects are well documented, and are used in analyses of Australian voting behaviour, along with other studies in other fields including; strategic planning (Valcik, 2012), healthcare (Ye et al. 2017) and geosciences. 

# modelling - just describe 'multiple groups'..'proportions'..'appropriate models like ...'
Answering question (1) involves modelling using the two-party preferred vote (%) as a function of an electorate socio-demographics. The vote for one of the parties $TPP_i$ is mapped as a continuous random variable on $TPP_i \in [0,1]$. Percentage swing vote (movement in percentage points) will also be of interest within question (1). Question (2) involves modelling the division of first preferences $FP_i$ for each party $i$, as a percentage of total votes. The outcome variable for each party is a continuous random variable on $FP_i \in [0,1]$, and the division of preferences $\sum_{i=1}^D FP_i = 1$, where $D$ is the number of parties.

# reproducible and openly available
All content produced is reproducible and data used is publically available, so this project provides a resource for future research.  A key deliverable is the contribution made to the $eechidna$ R package, which includes the GIS maps, data from both all censuses and elections, and the projected socio-demographic electorate profiles at the time of each election. The name $eechidna$ is an acronym for 'Exploring Election and Census Highly Informative Data Nationally for Australia'.



---------

Initial model iterations consider party support (% of votes in electorate) as independent of the support for other parties, but later models account for the relatedness of outcomes (sum to 1) inherent in compositional data. Conclusions are made on models selected by various criteria, including prediction accuracy.
