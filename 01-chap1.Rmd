# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Over the last two decades the Australian demographic profile has changed significantly. An ageing population, higher levels of education across the board, soaring house prices, the list goes on. At the same time, political power has moved back and forth between the two major parties - the Australian Labor Party (Labor) and the Liberal National coalition (Liberal). This leads to the question - what makes Australians vote the way they do?

This research will explore the relationships that exist between socio-demographics and voting behaviour of electorates in Australian federal elections. Each election since 2001 is modelled using ordinary least squares regression, and we analyse how socio-demographic effects have changed over time. In order to study temporal changes, we propose the use of standardized predictors and consistent model specification across elections.

Socio-demographics are characteristics of a population, such as percentage breakdowns by age, gender, ethnicity, education level and income. The socio-demographic information used in this study is from the Australian Census of Population and Housing (Census), a country-wide survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) every five years. Federal elections on the other hand, are generally conducted every three years.

Using these data sources, we aim to answer the research question, *what socio-demographics are the key determinants of support between the Labor and Liberal parties, and how have their effects changed over time?*.

Spatial analysis tools and geographical information software (GIS) are used to construct socio-demographic profiles for each electorate, at election time, using the available Census information. A sequence of dimension reduction and variable selection techniques are used to identify the most important variables to be included in the model for each election. 

As far as we can see, there are no existing studies that model any election from 2010 onwards as a function of socio-demographic characteristics, nor has any study attempted to use a regression framework to examine these relationships over time. 

Additionally, we devise a method of spatial imputation for election years in which a Census does not occur, which uses Census information from nearby years. Our method accounts for both the temporal and spatial differences in electorates at election time, and aggregated areas at Census time.

## Reproducible and openly available

All content produced in this study is reproducible and the data used is publicly available, so this project provides a resource for future research. A key deliverable is the contribution made to the *eechidna* R package, which includes the GIS maps, data from both all Censuses and elections, and the imputed socio-demographic electorate profiles at the time of each election. When the next elections and Censuses come around, the *eechidna* package will provide a resource for anyone wishing to conduct their own socio-political analysis. The name *eechidna* is an acronym for 'Exploring Election and Census Highly Informative Data Nationally for Australia'.
