# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Over the last two decades, Australia has changed in many ways. Rising house prices, country-wide improvements in education, an ageing population, and a decline in religious affiliation, are just a few facets of the country's evolving demographic. At the same time, political power has moved back and forth between the two major parties - the Australian Labor Party (Labor) and the Liberal National coalition (Liberal). The two-party preferred vote, a measure of support between these two parties, has been as high as 53.5% in favour of the Liberal party, and as low as 47.3%.

These simultaneous changes lead to our question - *what socio-demographics are key determinants of electorate support between the Labor and Liberal parties, and how have their effects changed over time?*

Existing studies of the 2001, 2004 and 2007 Australian federal elections reveal relationships between socio-demographics and voting behaviour, at an aggregate level. However, as far as we can see, there are no existing studies that investigate election from 2010 onwards.

This thesis explores the dynamics of electorate party preference for all six federal elections from 2001 to 2016, in an econometric framework. To gather insights on temporal trends, along with individual elections, the two-party preferred vote is modelled as a function of electorate socio-demographics.

Socio-demographics are characteristics of a population, such as percentage breakdowns by age, gender, ethnicity, education level and income. The socio-demographic information used in this study is from the Australian Census of Population and Housing (Census), a country-wide survey conducted every five years. Federal elections on the other hand, are generally conducted every three years. There are 150 electorates in Australia with each corresponding to a single seat in the House of Representatives. It is electorates that determine the result of Australian federal elections, which is why electorates are chosen as the level of aggregation for this study.

As Censuses and election are inherently asynchronous, we use spatial analysis tools and geographical information software (GIS) to construct socio-demographic profiles for each election, using information from the neighbouring Censuses. This follows an areal imputation approach, by linearly interpolating between Census years to approximate the profile of each electorate, at election time. In order to study temporal changes, consistent model specification and standardized predictors are used in each elections.

With $p = 63$ socio-demographic variables constructed from the Census information, and $n = 150$ electorates in each election, there is a problem of relatively small $n$ large $p$. First dimension is reduced to $p = 30$ by grouping similar variables into *factors*, which are found by executing principal component analysis on the socio-demographics. An information-theoretic technique is then applied to determine the top most important five variables in each election, and a superset is formed by taking the union of these subsets. This method involves conducting inference on a set of models via Akaike weights. Identical model specification is used for each election (i.e. the superset of variables and some two-way interactions), and models are estimated separately using ordinary least squares. Inference is then conducted using partial residual plots (main effects) and two-dimensional contour plots (two-way interactions).

All content produced in this study is reproducible and the data used is publicly available, so this project provides a resource for future research. A key deliverable is the contribution made to the existing `eechidna` R package, which includes the GIS maps, data from all Censuses and elections, and the imputed socio-demographic electorate profiles at the time of each election. When the next elections and Censuses come around, the `eechidna` package will provide a resource for anyone wishing to conduct their own socio-political analysis. The name `eechidna` is an acronym for 'Exploring Election and Census Highly Informative Data Nationally for Australia'.
