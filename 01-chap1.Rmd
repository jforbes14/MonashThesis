# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Over the last two decades, the Australian demographic has evolved in many ways. The population has aged and become less religious, house prices have risen and education levels grown across the country. At the same time, political power has moved back and forth between the two major parties - the Australian Labor Party (Labor) and the Liberal National coalition (Liberal). The two-party preferred vote, a measure of support between these two parties, has been as high as 53.5% in favour of the Liberal party (2013 election), and as low as 47.3% (2007). These simultaneous changes pose an interesting question - *what socio-demographics are determinants of electorate support between the Labor and Liberal parties, and how have their effects changed over time?*

Existing studies of the 2001, 2004 and 2007 elections reveal evidence of relationships between socio-demographics and voting behaviour, at an aggregate level. However, as far as we can see, there are no existing studies that investigate election from 2010 onwards.

This thesis explores the dynamics of electorate party preference for all six elections from 2001 to 2016. A regression framework is applied to model the two-party preferred vote as a function of electorate socio-demographics. The examination of temporal trends, along with individual election insights, is a contribution to the existing literature.

Socio-demographics are characteristics of a population, such as percentage breakdowns by age, gender, ethnicity, education level and income. The socio-demographic information used in this study is from the Australian Census of Population and Housing (Census), a country-wide survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) every five years. Federal elections on the other hand, are generally conducted every three years. Both Census and voting information is available at the electorate level of aggregation.

There are 150 electorates in Australia with each corresponding to a single seat in the House of Representatives. It is electorates that determine the result of Australian federal elections, which is why we have chosen to gather data at this level.

As Censuses and election are inherently asynchronous, we use spatial analysis tools and geographical information software (GIS) to construct socio-demographic profiles for each election, using the nearest Censuses. This follows an areal imputation approach, by linearly interpolating between Census years to approximate the profile of each electorate, at election time. In order to study temporal changes, we propose the use of standardized predictors and consistent model specification across elections.

With $p = 63$ socio-demographic variables constructed from the Census information, and $n = 150$ electorates in each election, we face the problem of having relatively small $n$ large $p$. We first reduce dimension to $p = 30$ by using principal component analysis to group similar variables into what we have called *factors*. An information-theoretic technique of is then used to determine the top most important five variables in each election, and we form a superset by taking the union of these subsets. This method involves conducting inference on a set of models via Akaike weights. Identical model specification is used for each election (i.e. the superset of variables and some two-way interactions), and models are estimated separately using ordinary least squares. Inference is then conducted using partial residual plots (main effects) and two-dimensional contour plots (two-way interactions).

All content produced in this study is reproducible and the data used is publicly available, so this project provides a resource for future research. A key deliverable is the contribution made to the existing `eechidna` R package, which includes the GIS maps, data from all Censuses and elections, and the imputed socio-demographic electorate profiles at the time of each election. When the next elections and Censuses come around, the `eechidna` package will provide a resource for anyone wishing to conduct their own socio-political analysis. The name `eechidna` is an acronym for 'Exploring Election and Census Highly Informative Data Nationally for Australia'.
