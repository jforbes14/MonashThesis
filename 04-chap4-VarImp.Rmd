## Variable importance

We begin this chapter by making one thing absolutely clear. Full reality cannot be included in a model [@BurnhamAnderson2002]. Rather, we seek to estimate a good model to yield an estimate of the more prominent relationships that exist between socio-demographics and electorate voting behaviour, based on the empirical data in hand. 

Even after reducing the dimension of our data set, we still have 30 possible predictors to choose from, and only 150 observations. To estimate a *good* model, we use variable selection to further reduce our data to around 12 variables, which capture the five *most important* variables in determining $TPP$ in each election. Our approach is based off a technique common in ecological studies, using Akaike weights to measure relative variable importance [@BurnhamAnderson2002].

For each election, we compute all possible five variable models ($m = 1, ..., {30 \choose 5}$) and use this as our model set from which to draw conclusions.

### A little bit of likelihood theory

This approach is fundamentally driven by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) [@Akaike73], which uses Kullback-Leibler (K-L) information as a basis for model selection [@BurnhamAnderson2002]. K-L information, $I$, for a true model $f$ and approximating model $g$ is given by:

$$I(f,g) = \int f(x) \log \Big( \frac {f(x)} {g(x|\theta)} \Big) dx$$ 

The K-L information can be interpreted as the information lost when $g$ is used to approximate $f$. Minimizing K-L distance is our goal in determining best fit, which is what we do by choosing a model (from a set) with minimum AIC.

By comparing the AIC of each model in the set with the minimum (optimal) AIC, we get a measure of relative information lost, and hence performance. Let $\Delta_m = AIC_m - AIC_{min}$, which is the difference in AIC between model $m$ and the minimum AIC in the model set. Akaike weights $w_m$ for each model $m$ are then calculated:

$$w_m = \frac {\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_m)} {\sum_{r=1} ^R \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_r)}$$

The Akaike weight represents the posterior probability that model $m$ is the best model in the set, without any beliefs a priori. The $w_m$ sum to one.

For each variable, we compute the sum of Akaike weights over models that include that variable, and use these as a measure of variable importance [@BurnhamAnderson2002]. Let $I$ denote the indicator function.

$$s_j = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m \cdot I(j \text{ used in model } m)$$

We select the five variables with largest $s_j$ across all $j \in J$ for each election, and use the super-set of these variables as our chosen predictors to be used across *all* elections. The top five variables for each election are shown in figure \@ref(fig:top4varimp).

The resultant super-set includes: Born_SE_Europe, ManagerAdminClericalSales, OneParent_House, CurrentlyStudying, LFRet, Educ, Extractive, Born_UK, RentLoan and NoReligion. 


### An alternative

An alternative measure of variable importance is to compare model-averaged coefficients, when the data has been scaled and centered (mean of zero, variance of one). This approach is suggested to be more appropriate by @Gillingham17, who suggests it may be more appropriate, although these claims are opposed by @GiamOlden16. We compare the our conclusions on variable imporance with conclusions we would have made using model-averaged coefficients.

The resultant super-set would contain: Born_SE_Europe, ManagerAdminClericalSales, OneParent_House, Extractive
OtherLanguageHome, MedianAge and Unemployed.

Whilst there are similarities between the two super-sets, the exclusions from our chosen super-set are OtherLanguageHome, which appears in the top 5 model-averaged coefficients every election, and Unemployed, which appears in the top 5 in two elections. We decide to add these both to our super-set, to mitigate risk of omitting an important variable.
