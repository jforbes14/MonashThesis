The six elections occuring from 2001 to 2016 are considered in this study, using socio-demographic information from the Census of Population and Housing. Comparisons are made across the six elections to examine whether socio-demographic variables have changing effects over time.

Data used in this study is available online from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the Australian Electoral Commission.
