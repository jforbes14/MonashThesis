# Literature review {#ch:litreview}

Existing econometric analysis of Australian federal elections are founded on pairing socio-demographic information from the nearest Census to the election of interest. The predominant approach uses GIS data to connect Census collection districts to the nearest polling booth, as done in @DavisStimson98, @Forrest01, @Stim06 (later adopted to an online e-research platform in @Liao09) and @Stimson2009. These studies use information disaggregated to polling booth locations - a greater level of disaggregation than electorates, which is the grouping of focus of this study.

Few studies have used regression techniques to understand the relationship between socio-demographics and party preference. @Forrest01 uses multiple regression to identify significant determinants of the primary vote for each party the Farrer electorate in the 1998 election, by modelling each party's share of primary votes as a separately using ordinary least squares (OLS). The adjusted R-squared obtained in these regressions ranged from 0.158 to 0.785, suggesting that some parties are more predictable than others. @Stimson2009 also applies a multiple regression framework to party preference, by modelling the swing vote in the 2007 election. Resultant models were relative poor fits (adjusted R-squared of 0.223). Both of these studies use a stepwise procedure to obtain a model on a reduced variable set, and had limited success achieving models that could adequately explain the response.

Another method to differentiate between party preference is to use principal component analysis, as in @Stimson2009 and @Stimson2012, whereby variables are summarised into linear combinations, which are orthogonal functions, and are ordered in their proportion of variance explained. Electorates are then assigned to a particular party based on their primary vote, and each party is then summarized by its mean z-scores in the directions of the first two principal components. Assignment in this case is only reasonable as the first two components exlain over 90% of variation in the covariates. Analysis across elections in @Stimson2009 are made by comparing these two discriminant functions, and the positions of the political parties. Whilst we do not assign parties in this way, we do use principal components to understand which variables appear grouped together.

Other election related studies that apply a similar framework predominantly model individual voter behaviour using survey data (see @Schram92, @Wilson2011 and @Gibson2011).

Seemingly absent from Australian studies is the examination of socio-political relationships using in a regression framework, over time. It also appears that no study has attempted any type of econometric analysis of socio-demographics and voter behaviour in Australia since 2007. This study covers the six Australian federal elections in the 21st century. We also note that all of these studies have paired electorate information (votes) with Census information (socio-demographics) from a single year. In this study we propose a method of spatial imputation for the election years without a Census, that uses information from the nearest Censuses on either side of the election.
