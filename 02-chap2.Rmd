# Literature review {#ch:litreview}

There exist only a handful of studies that conduct an econometric analysis of Australian federal elections using socio-demographic information. Amongst these, the predominant approach is to join data from the most recent Census that occurs prior to the election of interest using GIS data obtained at the collection district (Census) and polling booth (election) aggregate levels, as done in @DavisStimson98, @Forrest01, @Stimson06, @Liao09 and @Stimson09. Collection districts are joined to the nearest polling booth using euclidean distances. Our study is focused on electorates, which reflects a greater level of aggregation than polling booths. Therefore, we adopt a different method of matching Census information with electoral voting outcomes. Our chosen matching approach accounts for both the temporal and spatial nature of this data, based on the *piecewise approximation* method of areal imputation in @Goodchild1993.

As far as we know, a regression framework has only been applied in this context on two occasions. @Forrest01 use multiple regression to identify significant determinants of the primary vote for each party in the Farrer electorate during the 1998 election, by modelling each party's share of primary votes as a separate regression, each using ordinary least squares (OLS). The adjusted R-squared values obtained from these regressions range from 0.158 to 0.785, suggesting that some parties (including the Labor and Liberal parties) are more predictable than others. They found that age, education and migrant populations were important in relation to support for both Labor and Liberal. @Stimson09 also apply a multiple regression framework to party preference, by modelling the swing vote in the 2007 election. The resultant model has relative poor fit (adjusted R-squared of 0.223), and as such no conclusions about socio-demographic effects were made. Both of these studies use a stepwise procedure to reduce the variable set, and have limited success in providing rich insights into socio-demographic preferences.

Applying a stepwise procedure to a data set with a low number of observations per predictor is problematic [@Steyerberg2009]. In our study, each election is modelled as a separate cross-section containing 63 socio-demographic predictors, and 150 observations. Therefore, instead of stepwise selection, we adopt the information-theoretic approach of Akaike weights to determine relative variable importance [@BurnhamAnderson2002], and use this as a criteria for variable selection. Akaike weights are often used in ecological studies (see @Johnson2004 and @Symonds2011).

Another method to differentiate between party preference is to use principal component analysis on the socio-demographic variables, as shown by @Stimson06, @Stimson09 and @Stimson12. Electorates are assigned to a particular party based on their primary vote, and each party is then summarized by its mean z-scores in the directions of the first two principal components. For the 2001, 2004 and 2007 elections, the Labor party was found to appeal to lower income, younger and more multicultural areas, whereas the Liberal party was associated with higher income, older and more mono-cultural areas [@Stimson12]. Whilst we do not assign parties in this way, we do use principal components to understand and group similar variables together.

Other election related studies that aim to understand party preference predominantly model individual voter behaviour using survey data (see @Schram92, @Wilson2011 and @Gibson2011).

Seemingly absent from previous Australian studies is the use of a regression framework to examine these socio-political relationships over time. It also appears that no study has attempted any type of econometric analysis of socio-demographics in conjunction with voter behaviour in Australia since 2007. Unlike all previous studies, where election outcomes are paired with Census information (socio-demographics) from a single year only, this study covers the six Australian federal elections in the 21st century.
