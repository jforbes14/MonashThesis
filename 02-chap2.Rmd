# Literature review {#ch:litreview}

Only a handful of existing studies conduct an analysis of Australian federal elections using socio-demographic information. Amongst these, the predominant approach is to join data from the most recent Census that occurs prior to the election of interest. This is done using GIS data obtained at the collection district (Census) and polling booth (election) aggregate levels, as in @DavisStimson98, @Forrest01, @Stimson06, @Liao09 and @Stimson09. Collection districts are matched to the nearest polling booth. Our study is focused on electorates, which reflects a greater level of aggregation than polling booths. Therefore, we adopt a different method of matching Census information with electoral voting outcomes, based on the piece-wise approximation method of areal imputation in @Goodchild1993.

As far as we know, a regression framework using socio-demographics to understand election outcomes has been applied on two occasions. @Forrest01 use multiple regression to identify significant determinants of the primary vote for each party in the Farrer electorate during the 1998 election, by modelling each party's share of the primary vote as a separate regression, each using ordinary least squares. The adjusted R-squared values obtained from these regressions range from 0.158 to 0.785, suggesting that some parties (including the Labor and Liberal parties) are more predictable than others. They found that age, education and migrant populations were important in relation to support for both Labor and Liberal. @Stimson09 also apply a multiple regression framework to party preference, by modelling the swing vote in the 2007 election. The resultant model has relative poor fit (adjusted R-squared of 0.223), and as such no conclusions about socio-demographic effects were made. Both of these studies use a stepwise procedure to reduce the variable set, and have limited success in providing rich insights into socio-demographic preferences.

Applying a stepwise procedure to a data set with a low number of observations per predictor is problematic [@Steyerberg2009]. In our study, each election is modelled as a separate cross-section containing 63 socio-demographic predictors with only 150 observations. Therefore, instead of stepwise selection, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that uses Akaike weights to determine relative variable importance [@BurnhamAnderson2002], and use this as a criterion for variable selection. Akaike weights are often used in ecological studies (see @Johnson2004 and @Symonds2011).

Another method to differentiate between party preference is to use principal component analysis on the socio-demographic variables, as shown in @Stimson06, @Stimson09 and @Stimson12. Electorates are assigned to a particular party based on their primary vote, and each party is then summarized by its mean z-scores in the directions of the first two principal components. For the 2001, 2004 and 2007 elections, the Labor party was found to appeal to lower income, younger and more multicultural areas, whereas the Liberal party was associated with higher income, older and more mono-cultural areas [@Stimson12]. Whilst we do not assign parties to electorates in this way, we do use principal components to understand and group similar predictor variables together.

Other election related studies that aim to understand party preference predominantly model individual voter behaviour using survey data (see @Schram92, @Wilson2011 and @Gibson2011).

Seemingly absent from previous Australian studies is the use of a regression framework to examine these socio-political relationships over time. It also appears that no study has attempted any type of statistical analysis of socio-demographics in conjunction with voter behaviour in Australia since 2007. In this thesis, all six elections thus far held in the 21st century are examined.
