# Acknowledgements {-}

I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Di Cook and Prof. Rob Hyndman for the guidance and generous support they are provided throughout the year. I would also like to thank all the other Monash EBS staff and students for any teachings, help, motivation and ideas they have provided along the way.
