 abstract = {The article considers the efficiency of ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficient estimates relative to generalized least squares (GLS) in a linear regression model where the disturbances follow a spatial autocorrelation pattern. The main result is that the limiting relative efficiency of OLS, as correlation among disturbances increases, tends to either zero or unity for most design matrices and correlation patterns encountered in practice. Which of these cases applies depends on the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the spatial dependence matrix from the spatial autocorrelation scheme. In particular, the limiting relative efficiency of OLS is unity if this eigenvector lies in the column space of the design matrix. In practice, the relevant eigenvector will often be a column of ones. This implies that OLS is in the limit as good as GLS whenever there is a constant in the regression. We conclude, however, from several concrete examples that the loss in efficiency can still be substantial for intermediate degrees of autocorrelation.},
